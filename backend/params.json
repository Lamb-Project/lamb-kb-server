Neural networks are a subset of machine learning methods that are inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected neurons that process information. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses multiple layers of neural networks to extract high-level features from raw input data. Reinforcement learning is another approach where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.",

The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages in a valuable way. NLP combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process human language in text or voice data. Some common NLP tasks include sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, and question answering systems.",
